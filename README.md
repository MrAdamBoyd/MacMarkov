This is a Markov chain generator that I made based heavily on [this article](https://www.weheartswift.com/random-names-using-markov-chains/) from We Heart Swift. I edited their program to use sentences and full words instead of just generating a single word. The application has a very simple UI. Due to the inefficient (but simple) implementation, this program uses a lot of memory but is quite easy to understand. In addition, loading large text files (like the allshakespeare file I included) can take a very long time to process.
